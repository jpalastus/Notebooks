        "# **Classical Methods:** Introduction to Molecular Dynamics with LAMMPS and ASE\n",
        "\n",
        "As you've probably heard in the seminars until now, **Molecular Dynamics (MD)** is a computational simulation method used to model the physical movements of particles (typically atoms and molecules, but not only) over time. By numerically solving (technicaly, *integrating*) Newton's equations of motion, MD allows us to investigate the dynamical evolution of a system based on the forces acting between particles. These forces can be derived from *ab initio* methods or obtained from empirical models. *(Side note: machine-learned interatomic potentials, or MLIPs, can also be considered a type of empirical potential when trained on reference data.)*\n",
        "\n",
        "This first half of the notebook was designed to give you a taste of how we can use **ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)** together with **LAMMPS**, a powerful classical MD software, to set up and run a basic MD simulation.\n"

        "## First, a \"simple\" MD...\n",
        "As a first test case, we'll model **aluminium (Al)**, a widely used metal with a simple FCC (face-centered cubic) crystal structure that is easy to [build using ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/build/build.html). We'll perform a **temperature ramp simulation** of bulk aluminium using **periodic boundary conditions** to mimic an infinite crystal. Starting at a relatively low temperature (100 K), we will gradually increase the system temperature to 2000 K over 20,000 simulation steps. This controlled heating will help illustrate how thermal energy influences atomic motion and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, we'll use a many-body empirical potential known as the **Embedded Atom Method (EAM)** to describe atomic interactions. The specific potential file used can be retrieved from [this link](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/entry/2009--Zhakhovskii-V-V-Inogamov-N-A-Petrov-Y-V-et-al--Al/). EAM is an oldschool potential for modeling metallic systems, and even today it is widely used for its simplicity and well available parametrizations. It considers not only pairwise interactions between atoms but also the **embedding energy** associated with placing an atom into the local electron density generated by its neighbors. In this methodology, the total energy $E$ of a system of atoms is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\n",
        "E = \\sum_i F_i(\\bar{\\rho}_i) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i \\ne j} \\phi_{ij}(r_{ij})\n",
        "$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $F_i(\\rho_i)$ is the **embedding energy** for atom $i$, a function of the local electron density $\\rho_i$.\n",
        "- $\\bar{\\rho}_i = \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\rho_j(r_{i})$ is the local electron density at atom $i$ position, resulting from all neighboring atoms $j$.\n",
        "- $\\phi_{ij}(r_{ij})$ is a pairwise potential interaction between atoms $i$ and $j$.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are interested in understanding it a little more, try to check [this reference](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.29.6443) or [the EAM entry at LAMMPS manual](https://docs.lammps.org/pair_eam.html).\n",

Can you incorporate then in the logger and get a new plot? A good one for instance would be to plot the evolution of the six independent components of the symmetric stress tensor. Thet can be obtained in the traditional Voigt order (i.e., as $[xx, yy, zz, yz, xz, xy]$) from `atoms.get_stress()`. Be creative with your plot and try to see if any patern appears in the heating.\n",

Rather than running a single calculation in isolation, workflows help us build more complex simulations by automating steps such as system setup, simulation, data extraction, and post-processing.\n",

        "Workflows will be essencial when you want to study how a system evolves across a range of conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, composition), you need to reuse results from one step as the starting point for the next, you want to ensure consistency and reproducibility across simulations... If some few keywords can remain in your mind after this very broad definition, you should keep the information that workflows aim to be **repeatable** and **as automated as possible**.\n",

We will now perform a series of **NVT simulations** of bulk aluminium at constant temperatures ranging from **750 K to 1250 K**, in steps of 100 K. The goal is to observe how thermal energy affects atomic dynamics and equilibrium structure over those temperatures, but you can also compare the results to the ones we obteined in the ramp before.\n",

It is far from the more efficient code in the literature when we talk about computational performacy, where other codes (like FHI-aims, ORCA, VASP, Quantum Espresso, ...) should be prioritary.

        "\n",
        "While it is primarily designed for molecular quantum chemistry using Gaussian basis sets, PySCF also includes support for periodic (bulk) systems through its `pbc` modules. Unlike plane-wave-based codes (e.g., VASP or Quantum ESPRESSO), PySCF handles periodic calculations using Gaussian basis sets with k-point sampling. This makes it well-suited for prototyping periodic electronic structure methods, but it comes with limitations in terms of scalability and performance for large or complex solids. In this section, we illustrate how to define simple periodic systems (by no particular reason, a [diamond](https://diamond-diadem.github.io/) crystal), perform DFT calculations, generate the band structure, and understand what kinds of bulk simulations you can do with PySCF."
